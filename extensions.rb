# This "internal" context would map over if Adhearsion were invoked
# in Asterisk's own "internal" context. For example, if you set up
# your extensions.conf file for Adhearsion as so:
#
# [internal]
#     exten => _.,1,AGI(agi://192.168.1.3)
#
# then, when Adhearsion receives that call, it sees it came from
# the "internal" context and invokes this.
